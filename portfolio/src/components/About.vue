                I’m a software engineer who fell in love with computers after realizing they could do far more than just
                gaming. Over time, that curiosity grew into a passion for building systems and solving complex problems.
                I’m
                skilled in system design and versatile with Python, JavaScript, Go, and Linux, among other technologies.

                I’m an avid learner with a deep sense of curiosity, always eager to explore new tools and approaches.
                I’ve
                worked on multiple projects, from basic prototypes to advanced systems involving microservices
                architecture
                and database optimizations.

                My journey into tech began with a fascination for the command line — that simple yet powerful interface
                that
                sparked my desire to understand how things work under the hood. One day, I hope to build or contribute
                to
                something truly impactful — something that can make a real difference in society
