                I’m a software engineer who fell in love with computers after realizing they could do far more than just
                gaming. Over time, that curiosity grew into a passion for building systems and solving complex problems.
                I’m
                skilled in system design and versatile with Python, JavaScript, Go, and Linux, among other technologies.

                I’ve
                worked on multiple projects, from basic prototypes to advanced systems involving microservices
                architecture
                and database optimizations.

                that
                sparked my desire to understand how things work under the hood. One day, I hope to build or contribute
                to
                something truly impactful — something that can make a real difference in soci
